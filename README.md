# Assignment #3 - A Real Website 

## Overview
The goal of this assignment is to put everything we've done so far together. Your assignment will be a snazzy landing page (your new and improved version of Assignment 1). You are free to get creative with the look and feel (UI/UX) and the flow (Interaction Design), but you must use the tools we have covered up to this point.  When building this site, assume that product is pre-alpha (not yet available). Visitors can't buy your product yet, but you can get them excited about it, and let them sign up for your mailing list.

Specifically, look at the following requirements list: 

### General Requirements
1) Docker – two containers with Pyramid Web Server and MySQL Database
2) HTML – you can take inspiration from the web, but it must be your own code
3) CSS – you may not use any frameworks (other than the AgileCSS we built together in the tutorial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6VAfw4h4oU)
4) Javascript – you may not use any Javascript you have not written yourself (we will go more into JS in the next lecture)
5) Digital Ocean – you must deploy to Digital Ocean as prescribed in the tutorial to ensure consistency of TA support and grading
6) As in assignment #1, you need to have a landing page with a call-to-action to sign up for a newsletter, the records being stored in your database
7) You may collaborate with your teammmates on ideas, but each member must submit original code. Copying will result in an instant failure.

### Presentation Requirements

Your site must include the following elements:
1. The top (home) page must clearly and distinctly define your product -- and your brand.  Think carefully about what your team and your product "stand for" - and choose presentation styles/layout/fonts that speak to your audience.  This page must include a brief overview of the product -- with messaging that explains product benefits to your audience.  Refer to other real product sites to get a sense of how to do this.
2. A secondary pages for "product features" -- that articulate all the features of the product. 
3. An "about us" page -- that details who you team is, and what you stand for
4. A pricing page for each element of your pricing model. If you sell a single device, give that price, along with associated fees (storage, service, etc) if applicable. If you sell a subscription service of some type -- clearly show what the various pricing models for your service(s). 
5. A "sign-up" page where users can register for your mailing list -- to learn more about the product, as details become available.

> NOTE: Your site MUST be responsive, and demonstrate interactions with the user. Hover effects, scrolling effects, and other types of interactions should be considered. To do this, you'll need to create your own CSS AND javascript to implement this behavior.


### Clarification
Your MVP does NOT have to abide by these strict requirements. You may use whatever tools you wish, so long as you give credit where credit is due.

### Submission
1) Submit all of your source code to this repository.
2) In addition, add a REPORT.md file and provide the link to your public Digital Ocean IP address inside that document.
