In this assignment, I used the old files I utilized in assignment 1 of this course to build the skeleton of this assignment. I managed to build the pricing model and product features page of the assignment with minimal issue. Though in attempting to run the init_db.py script, I ran into some issues with the assignment.As it turns out, the database requires more manual generation than simply running a script, and eventually, after running a few commands in the web database docker container, I was able to initialize the database. In attempting to locate the webpages at IP address 64.227.56 port 80, I did not understand the full mechanics behind accessing the files on the server, and loaded the webserver.py file with no '/' default file. As a result, I accessed the server and ran in 404 errors. I eventually found out in a lab session with prof. Rick Gessner. That said, the navigational bar links still need to be fixed, as they do not redirect to the pages they are meant to and the css files do not load with the html webpage.
