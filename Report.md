In this assignment, I used the old files I utilized in assignment 1 of this course to build the skeleton of this assignment. I managed to build the pricing model and product features page of the assignment with minimal issue. Though in attempting to run the init_db.py script, I ran into some issues with the assignment.As it turns out, the database requires more manual generation than simply running a script, and eventually, after running a few commands in the web database docker container, I was able to initialize the database. In attempting to locate the webpages at IP address 64.227.56 port 80, I did not understand the full mechanics behind accessing the files on the server, and loaded the webserver.py file with no '/' default file. As a result, I accessed the server and ran in 404 errors. I eventually found out in a lab session with prof. Rick Gessner. Once the server webpage access issue was fixed, I still needed to ensure that the links worker. At first, they did not, and I struggled to look for points where the web_server.py and .html files failed to interact and eventually realized that the issue occurred because of the href link misspellings, so I was able to get the page links to work. With the links fixed, the database initialized, and the server access issues resolved, the only remaining problem involves the .css design and the images on each html webpage to display so that the website has an appealing appearance in its images and structure.
